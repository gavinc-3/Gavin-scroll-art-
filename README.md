I made two ACSII art's for this project. One of them is a mouse, which I took inspiration from my final project of Intro to CS last year, where I made a game involving mice and cheese blocks. The mouse is just the head, with its eyes looking to the right, and a nose of some downwards arrows. I later changed these to w's because VSCode was unable to print that character.
My second piece was a fish, which I took inspration from while scrolling through my camera roll and seeing some of the fish I caught during the summer. 
For my citation points, my first creation achieved a citation point of 1, ultra polite, where I made my own ASCII art and used it. My second piece also had a citation point of 1, since I made it myself as well, being ultra polite. The fish is angled towards the bottom left, with its head at the bottom and its tail fin at the top right. I also made some dorsal fins using dashes to add more texture and realism to the fish. 
I signed all of my ASCII in code, which is why the examples below do not have my initials. 
I think it is important to note that I used the tool "Ascii flow" as the program to make my art. 

Example of ASCII art pasted directly from Ascii Flow. These examples were modified slightly in VSCode for characters that Java was unable to print.

Process --- 

In order to make this, I started simply. I initially tried just printing one figure; the mouse. After working for an hour on that, I finally got it print in the terminal. I then repeated this process with the fish, and in the end, managed to combine them into a random printing of fish or mouse on top of each other. What this lacked was movmeent across the terminal which was very difficult. 

In order to do that, I had to start simply as well; breaking the project down. I started by trying to print just random string of periods across the terminal. I used a 1D array to achieve this, and using a while loop, printed an infinite loop of random periods. 
After doing that, I started working with the ASCII's but this was extremely difficult. I ended up switching my idea, and instead of printing one row, I printed a 2D array of [width][60], where 60 was just an arbitrary "frame". This 2D array would then be looped over and over again to create the loop. However, this makes it look very choppy and not smooth, which is something I would adress given more time. 


Submission to ASCII --
I have submitted the ASCII of my mouse to the ASCII collection and am pending approval by their admins.
