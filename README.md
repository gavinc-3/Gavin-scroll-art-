I made two ACSII art's for this project. One of them is a mouse, which I took inspiration from my final project of Intro to CS last year, where I made a game involving mice and cheese blocks. The mouse is just the head, with its eyes looking to the right, and a nose of some downwards arrows. I later changed these to w's because VSCode was unable to print that character.
My second piece was a fish, which I took inspration from while scrolling through my camera roll and seeing some of the fish I caught during the summer. 
For my citation points, my first creation achieved a citation point of 1, ultra polite, where I made my own ASCII art and used it. My second piece also had a citation point of 1, since I made it myself as well, being ultra polite. The fish is angled towards the bottom left, with its head at the bottom and its tail fin at the top right. I also made some dorsal fins using dashes to add more texture and realism to the fish. 
I signed all of my ASCII in code, which is why the examples below do not have my initials. 
I think it is important to note that I used the tool "Ascii flow" as the program to make my art. 

Example of ASCII art pasted directly from Ascii Flow. These examples were modified slightly in VSCode for characters that Java was unable to print.
